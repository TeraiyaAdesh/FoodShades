FoodShades is an open source food ordering android application developed in **Java** and **Kotlin**. FoodShades is mainly developed so I can improve my android development skills by building a real world application and experiment with different android components.

# ‚òÅÔ∏è Inspiration

FoodShades's main inspiration for it's UI comes from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.swiggy.android">Swiggy's</a> android app. I have incorporated some of the UI elements and features which the swiggy app had when I was developing the app.

# üíª Build Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository :

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TeraiyaAdesh/FoodShades.git
```

2. Import the project into Android Studio.

3. Create a firebase project and add this android app to the project.

4. Run the below command in the terminal to get your **SHA-1** key and upload it in the project settings in your firebase console, without this you cannot authenticate users using their phone numbers.

```shell
keytool -exportcert -list -v \
-alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore
```

5. Enable Phone Number sign in Firebase Authentication Tab in the left side.

6. Download and add the `google-services.json` file from the firebase project you created earlier and add it to the project under **app** folder.

7. Get your Mapbox Token and paste it in the `strings.xml` file

```
<string name="mapbox_access_token">REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN MAPBOX TOKEN</string>
```

8. Also paste the token in the `gradle.properties` file

```
MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN=REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN MAPBOX TOKEN
```

9. Setup a server which will generate a **CHECKSUM** Hash for the paytm sdk to work.After creating the server please paste the url which will return the **checksum** hash in the `CheckoutActivity.java` under the *ui/order* folder.Replace the GENERATE_CHECKSUM_URL with your own server url.

```java
public class sendUserDetailToServer extends AsyncTask<ArrayList<String>, Void, String> {
        private ProgressDialog dialog = new ProgressDialog(CheckoutActivity.this);
        //private String orderId , mid, custid, amt;
        String url ="GENERATE_CHECKSUM_URL";
```
